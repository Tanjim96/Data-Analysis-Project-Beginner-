README: Titanic EDA

Purpose:
This project is a beginner's exploration of the Titanic dataset, focusing on data analysis and visualization using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The goal is to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during the Titanic disaster.

Data:
* **Dataset:** Titanic passenger data
* **Source:** [Insert data source link here]

Libraries:
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib

Key Questions:
* What was the overall survival rate?
* How did survival rates differ between genders and passenger classes?
* Was there a correlation between age and survival?
* Did the presence of family members impact survival chances?

Data Analysis and Visualization:
Data Cleaning:
  No Cleaning was needed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualization:
  * Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) to explore relationships and trends
  * Use seaborn for attractive and informative plots

Findings:
  *Women had a higher survival rate than men.
  *Passengers in higher classes had a better chance of survival.

Future Work:
* **Advanced Analysis:**
  * Explore more complex models (e.g., logistic regression) to predict survival.
  * Consider feature engineering to create new variables.
* **Data Visualization:**
  * Experiment with different visualization techniques to enhance storytelling.
* **Additional Questions:**
  * Investigate other factors that might have influenced survival (e.g., ticket fare, cabin location).
